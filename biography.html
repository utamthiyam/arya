Aryabhata, also called Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder, (born 476, possibly Ashmaka or Kusumapura, India), astronomer and the earliest Indian mathematician whose work and history are available to modern scholars. He is also known as Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder to distinguish him from a 10th-century Indian mathematician of the same name. He flourished in Kusumapura—near Patalipurta (Patna), then the capital of the Gupta dynasty—where he composed at least two works, Aryabhatiya (c. 499) and the now lost

In Ganita Aryabhata names the first 10 decimal places and gives algorithms for obtaining square and cubic roots, using the decimal number system. Then he treats geometric measurements—employing 62,832/20,000 (= 3.1416) for π, very close to the actual value 3.14159—and develops properties of similar right-angled triangles and of two intersecting circles. Using the Pythagorean theorem, he obtained one of the two methods for constructing his table of sines. He also realized that second-order sine difference is proportional to sine. Mathematical series, quadratic equations, compound interest (involving a quadratic equation), proportions (ratios), and the solution of various linear equations are among the arithmetic and algebraic topics included. Aryabhata’s general solution for linear indeterminate equations, which Bhaskara I called kuttakara (“pulverizer”), consisted of breaking the problem down into new problems with successively smaller coefficients—essentially the Euclidean algorithm and related to the method of continued fractions.


With Kala-kriya Aryabhata turned to astronomy—in particular, treating planetary motion along the ecliptic. The topics include definitions of various units of time, eccentric and epicyclic models of planetary motion (see Hipparchus for earlier Greek models), planetary longitude corrections for different terrestrial locations, and a theory of “lords of the hours and days” (an astrological concept used for determining propitious times for action).

Aryabhatiya ends with spherical astronomy in Gola, where he applied plane trigonometry to spherical geometry by projecting points and lines on the surface of a sphere onto appropriate planes. Topics include prediction of solar and lunar eclipses and an explicit statement that the apparent westward motion of the stars is due to the spherical Earth’s rotation about its axis. Aryabhata also correctly ascribed the luminosity of the Moon and planets to reflected sunlight.

The Indian government named its first satellite Aryabhata (launched 1975) in his honour.

Bhaskara I
Indian astronomer and mathematician

Flourished: 601 - 650 Valabhi? India
Bhaskara I, (flourished c. 629, possibly Valabhi, near modern Bhavnagar, Saurashtra, India), Indian astronomer and mathematician who helped to disseminate the mathematical work of Aryabhata (born 476).

Little is known about the life of Bhaskara; I is appended to his name to distinguish him from a 12th-century Indian astronomer of the same name. In his writings there are clues to possible locations for his life, such as Valabhi, the capital of the Maitraka dynasty, and Ashmaka, a town in Andhra Pradesh and the location of a school of followers of Aryabhata. His fame rests on three treatises he composed on the works of Aryabhata. Two of these treatises, known today as Mahabhaskariya (“Great Book of Bhaskara”) and Laghubhaskariya (“Small Book of Bhaskara”), are astronomical works in verse, while Aryabhatiyabhashya (629) is a prose commentary on the Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata. Bhaskara’s works were particularly popular in South India.

Planetary longitudes, heliacal rising and setting of the planets, conjunctions among the planets and stars, solar and lunar eclipses, and the phases of the Moon are among the topics Bhaskara discusses in his astronomical treatises. He also includes a remarkably accurate approximation for the sine function: in modern notation, sin x = 4x(180 − x)/(40,500 − x(180 − x)), where x is in degrees.


In his commentary on the Aryabhatiya, Bhaskara explains in detail Aryabhata’s method of solving linear equations and provides a number of illustrative astronomical examples. Bhaskara particularly stressed the importance of proving mathematical rules rather than just relying on tradition or expediency. In supporting Aryabhata’s approximation to π, Bhaskara criticized the traditional use of Square root of√10 for it (common among Jain mathematicians).
